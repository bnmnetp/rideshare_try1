<h2>Creating a Ride</h2>
<p>To create a trip just click on the map somewhere.  A popup box will
appear and ask you if you want to make the trip to or from your college.  It
may be useful to use the zoom controls on the map to zoom in to your
destination or starting point.  This will make it easier to be precise
about where you are going to or coming from.  You may also create a
ride to a city by simply typing in an address, or a city, state in the
text box above the map.  This will place a pushpin on the map in the
center of the city or at the exact address you provide.
</p>

<p>Once you have selected a starting point or destination there is
some additional information to provide about the trip.  You need to
provide a contact number.  Preferably a cell phone number that
potential riders can contact you via text or voice, to get any
detailed starting or ending time information.  You also should set how
many riders you can take.  Finally make sure you set the date and
approximate time of departure.  We haven't made this any more specific
that early/late morning or early/late afternoon knowing that often
departure times are set exactly until closer to the time of the
trip.</p>

<h2>Joining an Existing Ride</h2>
<p>To join an exisiting ride simply click on a pushpin on the map.  A
  popup will appear that gives you information about the date, time,
  and driver for the trip.  Note that red pushpins indicate trips that
  start at Luther and go to the pin, whereas green pushpins indicate a
  trip that starts at the pushpin and goes back to Luther.
</p>


<h2>Finding out about my Trips</h2>
<p>To see the complete list of trips that you have created either as
  a driver or as a rider click on the 'Your Rides' tab on the
homepage.  You can also delete rides and get the phone numbers for
your riders or driver on this page.</p> 

<h2>Finding out about my driver</h2>
<p>We are working on implementing a profile page so that you can check
out your driver and/or riders.  This is not done yet, but we'll make
it available as soon as we can.</p>
